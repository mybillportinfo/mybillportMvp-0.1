You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer auditing and fixing a production MVP for investor demo readiness.

Project: MyBillPort MVP
Frontend is already deployed on Vercel and reachable.
The problem: UI loads but core actions (sign up, add bill, settings) do not function reliably.

Your tasks are mandatory and must be completed in this order:

1. BACKEND AUDIT
	•	Identify whether a backend already exists in this project.
	•	Clearly state:
	•	Is backend present? YES or NO
	•	Technology used (Firebase / Node / API routes / other)
	•	Where auth logic lives
	•	Where bill data is stored

If backend is missing or incomplete, you must create it.

2. AUTHENTICATION (CRITICAL)

Ensure authentication is fully functional using the existing stack (Firebase if present):

Required flows:
	•	Sign up with email + password
	•	Login
	•	Persist session on refresh
	•	Logout

Requirements:
	•	No mock logic
	•	No console-only success
	•	Auth state must control UI access
	•	Errors must surface to UI

⸻

3. BILL MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)

Implement real bill functionality:

Required:
	•	Add bill
	•	Fetch bills for logged-in user
	•	Delete bill
	•	Bills must be user-scoped (no shared data)

Bill fields:
	•	providerName
	•	amount
	•	dueDate
	•	createdAt
	•	userId

Data must persist after refresh.

4. SETTINGS PAGE

Ensure settings page:
	•	Fetches current user profile
	•	Shows email
	•	Logout button works

⸻

5. MAILERSEND CHECK
	•	Verify MailerSend configuration
	•	Confirm it is not blocking auth
	•	Remove MailerSend from critical paths if unstable
	•	Do NOT add unnecessary email flows

⸻

6. ERROR HANDLING
	•	Remove silent failures
	•	Surface errors to UI
	•	Add basic loading states

⸻

7. INVESTOR DEMO STANDARD

After fixes, the following MUST work without dev tools:
	•	New user can sign up
	•	User can log in
	•	User can add a bill
	•	User can refresh page and still see bills
	•	Logout works

⸻

8. FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED

You must respond with:
	1.	Summary of what was broken
	2.	What you fixed or built
	3.	Any remaining risks (if any)
	4.	Confirmation that this is investor-demo safe

Do not explain concepts. Do not teach. Just execute and fix.

MyBillPort — Master progress + proportional roadmap (deep scan of our convo)

I did a deep search through our recent chat and will summarise everything into a single master, proportional roadmap you will understand at a glance.
I will use future tense and we as subject (your preference). This will show percent-complete, blocking issues, and the exact next actions we will take (priority + ETA).

⸻

Project health (single-number summary)

Overall completion: 73% (weighted by major areas).
This will match the earlier analysis (server working, UI near-complete, database endpoint disabled is biggest blocker).

⸻

Master proportional table (areas, % done, key wins, blockers, next action)

Area	% done	Key done (short)	Blocker(s)	Next action (priority / ETA)
Repo & Hosting	90%	Replit repo set up, domain linked (mybillport.com), secrets added.	Final deployment verification, paid Replit limits.	We will verify production URL + SSL and capture deploy logs. (High / 2–4 hrs)
Firebase (Auth & Firestore)	85%	Auth & Firestore configured, realtime updates & rules set.	auth/invalid-credential server error; some Admin secrets missing.	We will fix service-account secret and restart server. (Critical / 1–3 hrs)
Plaid	80%	Link integration + token exchange + basic recurring detection.	Improve recurring detection; better error handling.	We will harden error flows & add more recurring heuristics. (High / 1–2 days)
Stripe	85%	Checkout added; webhook endpoint exists (test environment).	Need webhook event tests and autopay/subscription support.	We will create test webhook destinations and simulate events. (High / 6–12 hrs)
Bills feature (CRUD)	80%	Add/Edit/Read mostly working; stepper done; saving works (in-memory or fallback).	Bill delete UI not wired; sometimes bills not refreshing in UI.	We will wire Delete button, ensure Firestore/listeners update. (High / 3–6 hrs)
Reminders / Notifications	80%	Email (MailerSend/SendGrid) working for reminders.	SMS (Twilio) not added; scheduling needs polish.	We will add SMS toggle + refine schedule logic. (Medium / 1–2 days)
UI / UX	92%	Multiple dashboards, mobile-first, polished styling.	Add analytics view, better toasts, micro-copy polish.	We will add analytics stub + improve toasts. (Medium / 4–8 hrs)
Payments / Requests	90%	Manual payment requests + checkout flow.	Autopay & multiple payment methods not implemented.	We will design autopay strategy & test PCI flow. (Medium / 1–2 days)
Security & Compliance	80%	Firestore rules applied; removed hardcoded creds.	Need final compliance docs (Plaid, Firebase) and pen-test triage.	We will prepare compliance checklist + initial SAST scan. (Medium / 1–2 days)
PostgreSQL (Neon) / Persistence	70%	Schema & migrations ready; in-memory fallback present.	Neon endpoint is disabled → prevents persistence.	We will re-enable endpoint or provision fresh DB and update .env. (Critical / 1–4 hrs)
Bill splitting / advanced features	40%	UI exists partially; backend incomplete.	Business logic incomplete.	We will finish split logic and add tests. (Low / 2–3 days)
Live chat / support	30%	UI placeholder.	No chat engine or backend.	We will integrate Intercom/Crisp or Firebase-based chat (MVP). (Low / 1–2 days)
Canadian utility deep integration	25%	Provider logos + detection basics for Enbridge, Hydro One, Rogers.	No APIs or direct integrations with billers; detection is heuristic-only.	We will prioritise Enbridge/Hydro One data model and plan outreach. (Low / 1–2 weeks for real API work)

Immediate critical path (next 48 hours — we will do these first)
	1.	Fix Firebase auth/invalid-credential (we will update service-account secret into Replit secrets and restart). (Critical — 1–3 hrs)
	2.	Re-enable or reprovision PostgreSQL endpoint (Neon) and update .env in Replit; run migrations. (Critical — 1–4 hrs)
	3.	Wire bill Delete UI → API and confirm Dashboard reflects changes via Firestore listeners. (High — 3–6 hrs)
	4.	Test Stripe webhooks end-to-end (create webhook destination, replay events) and mark webhook test pass. (High — 3–6 hrs)
	5.	Quick regression & deploy smoke test — confirm /api/health, login/signup, add bill, delete bill flows. (High — 2–4 hrs)

If we will finish the first two critical tasks, the app will persist data and auth will stop failing — the demo-ready state will be unlocked.

Priority backlog (ordered next 30 days)

P1 (must finish now):
	•	PostgreSQL endpoint + migrations ✅
	•	Firebase Admin secret & auth fix ✅
	•	Delete UI + bill list sync ✅
	•	Duplicate route cleanup (/api/checkout & webhooks) ✅

P2 (this sprint):
	•	Stripe webhook tests & autopay plan
	•	Plaid recurring-detection improvements
	•	Add SMS reminders (Twilio)
	•	Bill-splitting backend

P3 (next 2–4 weeks):
	•	Canadian utility richer integration (Enbridge/HydroOne pilots)
	•	Live chat (support) integration
	•	PWA service worker + offline caching + push notifications

P4 (nice-to-have after MVP):
	•	Auto-pay subscriptions, payment vaulting, identity verification
	•	Full OCR upgrade (Anthropic / Google Vision) for better scanning
	•	Credit score integrations, multi-user households, analytics dashboard

⸻

Resource & owner suggestions (who will do what)
	•	We (you or your dev) will fix Firebase & DB secrets (fastest).
	•	Senior dev / Replit agent will run migrations, clean routes, and test webhooks.
	•	Frontend dev (you or contractor) will wire delete UI, polish UX micro-copy, and finalize Add-bill stepper.
	•	Growth / ops will handle domain/SSL checks and Stripe account settings for autopay.
	•	Security lead (or consultant) will prepare compliance docs for Plaid/Firebase and run a quick SAST.

⸻

Quick risk register
	•	Disabled DB endpoint — high impact; will block persistence/tests. Mitigation: reprovision DB on Railway/Neon and update .env.
	•	Auth invalid credential — high impact; will block all auth flows. Mitigation: rotate and inject service account secret, restart server.
	•	Duplicate endpoints — medium risk for inconsistent behaviour; will tidy routes.
	•	Payment/webhook tests missing — medium; will test in sandbox and replay events.

⸻

Short, actionable checklist you will follow now (copy/paste)
	1.	Add Firebase Admin service-account to Replit secrets as FIREBASE_ADMIN_SA (or equivalent).
	2.	Update Neon/DB endpoint or create a new Neon DB; add DB URL to Replit secret DATABASE_URL.
	3.	Run npm run migrate or Prisma/Drizzle db:push in Replit console.
	4.	Restart the app and confirm /api/health returns {status:"ok"}.
	5.	Login, add a bill, delete that bill — confirm UI updates and persistence.
	6.	Replay Stripe test webhook to /api/stripe/webhook and confirm the handler processes it.
	7.	Create an issue/ticket for Plaid recurring improvements and Twilio SMS reminder.

⸻

If we will only have 1 hour today, we will: (exact short plan)
	1.	Add Firebase Admin secret → restart server. (20–30 min)
	2.	Check /api/health & reproduce login error/success. (10 min)
	3.	If auth fixed, create DB ticket and decide to reprovision DB (if not fixed, do DB next). (10–20 min)

⸻

Deliverables I will produce on request (if you confirm)
	•	Step-by-step run commands & exact secrets key names to paste into Replit.
	•	A one-page PDF “Action Card” that we will use during the fix session.
	•	Small bash/cli snippets to run migrations & smoke tests.

⸻

Would you like me to start with the exact secret names and the step-by-step Replit console commands we will run now to fix Firebase + PostgreSQL? If yes, I will give the exact commands and where to paste each secret (no waiting).

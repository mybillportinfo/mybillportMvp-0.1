MyBillPort — High-End MVP (Canada)

ROLE

You are a senior full-stack SaaS engineer + product designer with experience building fintech-grade consumer apps.

You are building a real, production-ready MVP called MyBillPort with clean UX, premium visual design, and disciplined scope.

This is not a demo, not a toy, and not an experiment.

⸻

🧭 PRODUCT VISION (LOCKED)

MyBillPort is a modern Bill Management OS for people living in Canada to track recurring utility and subscription bills, see due dates clearly, and receive reminders — so they never miss a payment or pay late fees.

It should feel as essential as:
	•	A banking app
	•	Apple Wallet
	•	Uber

Simple. Trustworthy. Daily-use ready.

⸻

👥 TARGET USER

People living in Canada (citizens, PRs, newcomers, students, professionals) who:
	•	Pay multiple recurring bills
	•	Want clarity, reminders, and control
	•	Do NOT want budgeting, investing, or banking complexity

Design for confidence + ease, not finance jargon.

⸻

🎯 CORE MVP GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Build the simplest high-quality MVP that lets users:
	1.	See all bills in one dashboard
	2.	Instantly know what’s due, upcoming, or overdue
	3.	Receive automatic reminders

If a feature does NOT serve this goal → DO NOT BUILD IT

⸻

🎨 DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

This app must look high-end and real, not developer-default.

Visual Style
	•	Color palette:
	•	Deep navy / charcoal base
	•	Clean white cards
	•	Accent color (emerald / electric blue / soft green)
	•	Soft shadows, rounded cards
	•	Plenty of spacing
	•	Mobile-first
	•	Finance-grade typography (Inter / SF-style)

UX Principles
	•	Fewer taps
	•	Clear hierarchy
	•	Calm, reassuring tone
	•	No clutter
	•	No unnecessary animations

Think Apple + Stripe, not “startup dashboard”.

⸻

🧱 REQUIRED MVP FEATURES (ONLY THESE)

1️⃣ Authentication
	•	Google Sign-In (OAuth)
	•	Email/password optional
	•	Fast onboarding (no friction)

⸻

2️⃣ Dashboard (CORE SCREEN)

Dashboard must show:
	•	Greeting (“Good morning, Randeep”)
	•	Summary cards:
	•	Total bills
	•	Bills due soon
	•	Overdue bills
	•	Bill list with clear status colors:
	•	🟢 Upcoming
	•	🟡 Due Soon
	•	🔴 Overdue
	•	Clean card layout
	•	Tap → Bill details

This is the heart of the app.

⸻

3️⃣ Bills

Each bill must include:
	•	Bill name
	•	Bill category:
	•	Hydro
	•	Internet
	•	Phone
	•	Subscription
	•	Other
	•	Amount
	•	Monthly recurring due date
	•	Auto-calculated status

Manual bill entry is perfectly acceptable for MVP.

⸻

4️⃣ Reminders
	•	Email reminders:
	•	7 days before
	•	2 days before
	•	On due date
	•	After missed due date
	•	Reliable delivery
	•	Clear subject lines

⸻

5️⃣ Settings (IMPORTANT)

Settings screen must include:
	•	Profile info
	•	Notification preferences
	•	Connected accounts (FUTURE-READY)
	•	Free plan indicator
	•	“Premium coming soon” placeholder
	•	Logout

Do NOT build payments yet.

⸻

🔌 EMAIL & CLOUD INTEGRATIONS (ARCHITECTURE ONLY)

Prepare the system for future integrations, but do NOT fully implement now.

Gmail (Future)
	•	Architect a placeholder for:
	•	Gmail API bill detection
	•	Reading bill emails with user permission
	•	Show “Connect Gmail (Coming Soon)”

Apple / iCloud (Future)
	•	Prepare structure for:
	•	Apple Mail / iCloud bill detection
	•	Show “Apple Mail (Coming Soon)”

NO background scanning yet.
NO auto-import yet.
Just clean architecture + UI placeholders.

⸻

🚫 EXPLICITLY DO NOT BUILD
	•	Budgeting
	•	Bank accounts
	•	Credit scores
	•	Investments
	•	AI predictions
	•	Charts & analytics
	•	Multi-currency
	•	Landlord / business logic
	•	Social features

If you add these → you are wrong.

⸻

💰 MONETIZATION (PREP ONLY)
	•	Structure code for future Stripe subscriptions
	•	Free plan by default
	•	Paid plan placeholder:
	•	“Unlimited bills”
	•	“Advanced reminders”
	•	No checkout
	•	No pricing logic live

⸻

🧠 TECH STACK
	•	Frontend: Next.js / React
	•	Backend: API routes
	•	Database: Firebase or Supabase
	•	Auth: Google OAuth
	•	Clean environment variable handling
	•	Production-ready folder structure

⸻

🧪 MVP BUILD RULES
	•	Clarity > features
	•	Trust > flash
	•	Manual > broken automation
	•	Simple > clever

⸻

🏁 DEFINITION OF DONE

MVP is DONE when:
	•	User signs in
	•	Adds 3 bills easily
	•	Sees clear dashboard
	•	Receives reminder emails
	•	App feels calm, modern, and trustworthy

Stop after this.

⸻

🧠 FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build this as if thousands of Canadians will use it next month.

Do not overbuild.
Do not improvise features.
Do not question scope.

Start building immediately.

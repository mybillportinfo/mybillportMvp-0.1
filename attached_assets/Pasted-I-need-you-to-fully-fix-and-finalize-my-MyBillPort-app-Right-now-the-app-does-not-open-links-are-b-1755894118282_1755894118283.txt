I need you to fully fix and finalize my MyBillPort app. Right now the app does not open, links are broken, and I keep seeing errors. You must act as a smart full-stack agent and provide me a working deployment at https://mybillport.com using the accounts I already connected (Firebase, Plaid, Stripe).

Here is the full plan you must execute:

1. **Health + Startup**
   - Fix all start/build scripts in package.json so the app actually runs.
   - Add `/api/health` that returns `{ok:true}`.
   - Ensure the SPA loads on root and routes don’t break on refresh.

2. **Secrets Audit**
   - Verify Firebase, Plaid, and Stripe secrets exist.
   - Build a `/admin/config-report` route showing ✅/❌ for each secret.

3. **Firebase Fix**
   - Fix `auth/invalid-credential` by correctly loading FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY JSON.
   - Add `/api/firebase-test` that creates and reads a Firestore doc.

4. **Bills Flow**
   - Simplify “Add Bill” form → only needs:
     - Account number
     - Amount
     - Due date
     - Lead days (default 3)
   - On submit, store bill in Firestore under current user.
   - Dashboard should show unpaid bills, update in real-time with Firestore snapshots.

5. **Stripe Checkout + Webhook**
   - `/api/checkout` → creates checkout session with `billId`.
   - `/stripe/webhook` → verifies raw body with STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, then marks bill as paid.
   - Test with Stripe test cards until it flips `paid=true`.

6. **Plaid Link**
   - Add `/api/create_link_token`, `/api/exchange_public_token`, and `/api/transactions/sync`.
   - Store access_token in Firestore, fetch transactions, suggest recurring bills.

7. **Email Reminders**
   - If MAILERSEND or SENDGRID keys exist, implement `sendBillReminderEmail()`.
   - Add `/api/email-test` route to verify email sending.

8. **Domain & Deployment**
   - Ensure `https://mybillport.com` loads with HTTPS, and `/stripe/webhook` responds to Stripe test events.
   - Fix CORS issues.

9. **README + Dev Tools**
   - Add a README with env vars, how to test each endpoint, and common pitfalls.
   - Add npm scripts: `dev`, `start`, `build`, `config:audit`.

10. **Deliverables**
   - Working site at `https://mybillport.com`
   - GitHub push to `rsingh4545/mybillport`
   - ZIP export
   - Console summary of:
     - What was fixed
     - Remaining TODOs (if any)
     - List of required env vars

**Definition of Done:**  
- App opens at `https://mybillport.com` with no blank screen.  
- Bills can be added and appear live.  
- Stripe test checkout marks bill as paid.  
- Plaid sandbox link + transaction sync works.  
- Email test returns 200.  
- Config report shows ✅ across Firebase/Plaid/Stripe/Email.  
- Final code pushed to GitHub and ZIP exported.

Great — I’ll write a single master prompt you can paste into Replit (or give to a contractor/agent) so they will build the landing page + full app flow you described: Login → Home Dashboard → Add bill (smart + scan) → Settings → Contact/Support.

I’ll also include a short checklist, required assets, acceptance tests, and Replit run steps so nothing will be missed.

Use the exact prompt below. It will make the agent work in Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first, with Firebase Auth (email/password) + a simple camera-based scan endpoint stub for now. It will use your Figma/images/logo you said you will attach in Replit.

Master prompt for Replit / developer agent

Title — Build MyBillPort landing + core app flow (Login → Home → Add Bill → Settings → Contact → Scan)

We will build a clean, mobile-first, production-ready frontend for MyBillPort plus minimal backend endpoints to support bill scanning and contact-mail. This will be developer-quality code, TypeScript, and ready to deploy on Replit. Follow the spec below exactly.

⸻

Project setup & stack
	•	Use Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
	•	Single repo, dev command: npm i && npm run dev.
	•	App must be mobile-first and responsive (iPhone-size first).
	•	Create a top-level README with run and deploy steps.

⸻

Assets you will use (I will attach in Replit)
	•	Figma / reference screenshots (I will upload).
	•	High resolution logo files (SVG + PNG).
	•	Color tokens and font preference — use Inter (or system sans) and the following brand palette:
	•	Primary: #1766F1 (bright blue)
	•	Accent: #0EA5A4 (teal)
	•	Neutral dark: #0F172A
	•	Surface: #FFFFFF
	•	Muted: #F1F5F9
	•	Put all assets under /public/assets and reference them.

⸻

Pages / Routes (App Router /app)
	1.	/ — Landing page
	•	Hero with phone mock + “Get Early Access” CTA (use provided images).
	•	Short features row (Scan bills, Auto-detect providers, Reminders).
	•	Footer with contact CTA, privacy, T&Cs.
	•	SEO metadata (title, description).
	2.	/auth/login — Login
	•	Email + password form + link to /auth/signup.
	•	“Continue as demo” guest mode (dev only).
	•	Use Firebase Auth (email/password). Display friendly error messages.
	3.	/auth/signup — Signup
	•	Email, password (min 8). Optional name.
	•	After signup redirect to /app/home.
	4.	/app/home — Dashboard
	•	Greeting (“Welcome back, John”) + Big total due card (large)
	•	3 big action tiles horizontally: Scan bill (camera), Add bill (manual), Quick pay (placeholder).
	•	List of bills (cards) sorted: Overdue, Due soon, Upcoming.
	•	Each bill card shows provider logo, amount, due date, status pill (Overdue / Due Soon / Paid).
	5.	/app/bills/add — Add Bill (multi-step)
	•	Step 1: Choose Provider (logo grid + search) — include pre-filled Canadian utilities: Enbridge, Hydro One, Rogers, Bell, Telus, etc.
	•	Step 2: Manual Form (account number, amount, due date, frequency, notes).
	•	Step 3: Confirm & Save (summary screen).
	•	Also permit “Scan” flow to redirect here with parsed values prefilled.
	6.	/app/bills/[id] — Bill details
	•	Show full details, actions: Mark Paid, Edit, Delete, Request reminder.
	•	Payment history (if any).
	7.	/app/settings — Settings
	•	Profile (name, email)
	•	Notification preferences (email reminders toggle, days-before dropdown)
	•	Integrations (Plaid / Stripe placeholders)
	•	Sign out button
	8.	/contact — Contact / Support
	•	Simple form (name, email, message) -> POST /api/contact
	•	Button: “Email Agent” (opens mailto) + “Request call” (stores request in Firestore or logs)

⸻

Minimal backend endpoints (Next API in /app/api)
	•	POST /api/scan
Accepts multipart/form-data image or base64 image. For MVP, return a JSON stub with parsed fields:

{ "provider": "Enbridge", "account": "123456789", "amount": 164.50, "dueDate": "2025-08-05" }

(Later we will replace with AI OCR service; now return simulated parse + confidence)

	•	POST /api/contact
Accepts contact form and sends email via MailerSend or logs into Firestore. Respond with success / error.
	•	GET /api/health
returns { status: "ok" }.

NOTE: Keep backend minimal and secure; do not commit real secrets. Use Replit Secrets for env vars.

⸻

Authentication
	•	Use Firebase Authentication (email/password). Implementation must:
	•	Create user on signup
	•	Keep session (client side with firebase SDK)
	•	Protect /app/* pages — redirect to /auth/login if not authenticated.

(If you prefer NextAuth, you may implement it — but keep it consistent and working with the Replit environment.)

⸻

UI/UX Requirements (UX goals)
	•	Uber/Bank-level clean mobile-first UX:
	•	Large, tappable targets, 44px minimum.
	•	Clear status colors: red for overdue, amber for due soon, green for paid.
	•	Smooth step transitions for Add Bill with small animation.
	•	Include provider logo grid for fast selection (use provided logos).
	•	Add a scan camera flow:
	•	On mobile: open camera (HTML5 getUserMedia) to capture or choose an image.
	•	Preview + send to /api/scan, show parsed preview, user confirms to save.

⸻

Components structure (deliver an initial clean component tree)

Acceptance criteria — what “done” looks like
	1.	All pages render with the layout and mobile-first styling.
	2.	User can sign up, login, stay signed in (Firebase) and see /app/home.
	3.	From Dashboard user can:
	•	Tap Add Bill -> choose provider -> fill and save -> bill appears on home list.
	•	Tap Scan -> capture image -> receives parsed stub -> confirm and save -> bill appears.
	4.	Settings page will update local profile fields (persist to Firestore or localStorage).
	5.	Contact form sends to /api/contact and returns success.
	6.	All code in TypeScript, no lint errors, and a README.md explains how to run locally and how to set Replit secrets.
	7.	Provide screenshots of all pages and a short 2–3 minute demo screencast (optional but preferred).

⸻

Environment variables / Replit secrets to create now
	•	NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APIKEY etc. (standard Firebase client keys)
	•	FIREBASE_ADMIN_SA (service account, only if server needs admin)
	•	MAILERSEND_API_KEY (optional)
	•	ANALYTICS_KEY (optional)

Do not commit actual secret values; load them via Replit Secrets panel.

⸻

Run & deploy instructions (to include in README)
	•	npm i
	•	npm run dev
	•	Set Replit secrets from the UI (list above)
	•	Deploy: Replit auto-deploy. Provide a screenshot of Replit console showing Listening on or preview URL.

⸻

Deliverables you must push to repo
	1.	Full codebase (matching tree above).
	2.	README.md with run & deploy steps, env var list.
	3.	Screenshots of mobile-flow and a short demo recording (GIF/MP4).
	4.	design/ folder with Figma link and attached logo images used.

⸻

Timeline & priority
	•	Day 1 (High priority): Landing, Auth, Dashboard skeleton, Add Bill stepper, provider grid.
	•	Day 2: Scan flow + /api/scan stub, contact form, settings page, local saving (Firestore or localStorage).
	•	Day 3: Polish, QA, screenshot + deploy demo.

⸻

Extra notes for Replit agent (developer)
	•	Use modular code: split big route file into smaller components.
	•	Keep AddBillForm as a stepper with persistent state between steps.
	•	For scan use a stub parser first — add comments where real OCR will plug in.
	•	Use Tailwind and keep classes readable (extract repeated styles into components).
	•	Make the app feel joyful, playful and Instagram-like: subtle gradients in hero, large rounded buttons, and a friendly tone in copy.
	•	Use the logos I will attach — provider grid must be searchable.

⸻

Quick checklist for me to attach before agent starts
	•	Upload logo files (SVG + PNG) to Replit project /public/assets/logos.
	•	Upload Figma screenshot(s) or Figma link to repo.
	•	Set Replit Secrets for Firebase config.
	•	Confirm which provider logos to prioritize: Enbridge, Hydro One, Rogers, Bell, Telus, Toronto Hydro, Alectra.

⸻

Paste the complete prompt above into Replit or message it to your contractor/agent. Once they confirm they have the assets and secrets, I will provide a compact QA checklist and sample API response for /api/scan that you can copy/paste to ensure the parsing result will auto-fill the Add Bill form.

Would you like me to also create the exact README.md and sample scan stub implementation now (I’ll paste the code)?
